<%= homework_hdr %>
1. Read this tutorial: [Making a simple, database driven website with Sinatra and Heroku](http://samuelstern.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/making-a-simple-database-driven-website-with-sinatra-and-heroku/). Here you will see essentially all the basic steps you would need to create a simple version of nanoTwitter. Expect not to understand everything but I want you to start getting a feel of the lay of the land. Do the work inside your <%=link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `sinatraintro`.

**Important** There are some problems in the detailed code you see in the tutorial,  so instead ot typing in the code you see in the example, please use this code: [Github of Sinatra Demo]( https://github.com/pitosalas/sinatrademo). It is very similar to what's in the web site but it will be easier to get to work.

I have done the complete example and made a video of it. Feel free to follow it.

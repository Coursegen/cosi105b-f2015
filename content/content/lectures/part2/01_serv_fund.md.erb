1. Read and do all the steps in this tutorial: [Making a simple, database driven website with Sinatra and Heroku](http://samuelstern.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/making-a-simple-database-driven-website-with-sinatra-and-heroku/). Here you will see essentially all the basic steps you would need to create a simple version of nanoTwitter. Expect not to understand everything but I want you to start getting a feel of the lay of the land. Do the work inside your <%=link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `sinatraintro`.

    I have done the complete example and made a video of it. Feel free to follow it but you must also type it in on your computer and get it to work. As for help if you require it!

* Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. Make sure your code is all in your Portfolio, directory “movies-2” and that it works. Look closely at the end of (PA) Movies Part 2 where two deliverables are specified. <%= deliverable("Upload your code to github; run it through Codeclimate; write a post with the requested information about your solution.") %>

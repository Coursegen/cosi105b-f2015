<%= homework_hdr %>

1. Read \[SODRR\] Chapter 1 and attempt to get it to work on your computer
  * Do coding on your own computer in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %> in a new top level directory called `user-service`
  * This chapter builds on the basics we covered at the last lecture. It covers much of the same ground as the last tutorial, but goes a little further. Try to develop an understanding of:
    1. What a web server is and how Sinatra helps you create one
    1. Meaning of the URL
    1. ActiveRecord as the bridge between Ruby and the relational database
    1. The relationship between the client and the server
    1. How Unit testing is done with Rspec
    1. The idea of Test Driven Development
    1. HTTP and it's different Verbs like GET, PUT, POST etc.
  * To help your reading and doing, here's a video of the first 18 pages of that chapter with extensive commentary and conceptual explanations:

  * Because the book is a couple of years old, there are some changes you need to keep in mind in order to get it to work on your own computer. They are all mentioned in the video but here they are again:
    1. gem is called `active_record` (not activerecord)
    1. No need to require 'rubygems' anymore (since Ruby 2.0)
    1. The first few lines of service_spec.rb change a lot. [Click here to see a working example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pitosalas/sotl-user-service/master/spec/service_spec.rb)

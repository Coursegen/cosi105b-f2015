  Read these three papers. Write a reflection (1-2 pages) summarizing your response key points that these papers. What did you learn? What is the value of formal studeies and research in Computer Science to the overall enterprise of software engineering at scale -- if any?. How do considerations such as that affect the way you view your future career in Computer Science?"

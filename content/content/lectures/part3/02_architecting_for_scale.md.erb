* Read \[SODRR\] Chapter 4. This is a hard, conceptual chapter. You will want to come back to it later in the course. Try to understand:
  * The core concept of partitioning the workload into services. Exactly what do they mean by a 'service'. Why would you partition it? For nanoTwitter name one bit of functionality that could be partitioned into a separate service.
  * What is meant by the design of the API of services. What is the relationship with HTTP and the URI? What is the conneciton with the concept of Routing that we discussed with Sinatra?
  * <%= deliverable "Reflect on this chapter by giving your responses to the questions posed above. 1 page or less, pdf." %>
* Work on nT with team
  * <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %> sections: HTMLUI and SINATRAAPP

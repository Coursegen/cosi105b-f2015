<%= homework_hdr %>
* **Teams:** Continue working on nT 0.5. See <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %> and also <%= link_to_topic :nt_load_testing %>
* **Read**: Here's an excellent article introducing the topics we will be discussing today: [Ruby Concurrency and Parllelism: A Practical Tutorial](http://www.toptal.com/ruby/ruby-concurrency-and-parallelism-a-practical-primer). It's a little complicated, but really really worth your time and effort. You will learn a lot. <%= deliverable "Warmup Questions" %>

### Scaling patterns: Concurrency
* Do more with the available resources
* Do more things at the same time
* Resource idle time is your enemy
  * CPU
  * Network
  * Disk
  * Database

#### Scenarios when concurrency is an option
* Users can ask for a detailed report about their twitter traffic
  * It can be a one shot, or regenerated at midnight
  * It can be displayed on the screen or emailed
  * Inline is no good because of computational cost and error handling
* Users tweet with attached images
  * Submitted in all kinds of formats, shapes and sizes
  * Need to convert and resize to standard shapes and sizes
  * Inline no good due to computational cost and error handling
* System sends an email to newly registered users
  * After creating the new user in db, send a confirm email with a link
  * Inline is no good, due to network latency and error handling

### Scaling pattern: concurrency on a single computer

* Difference between syncrhonous and asynchronous
* Difference between concurrent and parallel

#### Processes and Threads
* Key Operating System facility for concurrency
* Processes ("forking")
  * Use more memory (new VM for each process)
    * for the data + the program + everything
    * "Copy on write"
  * Context switching very expensive
  * Communication expensive (IPC or file system)
  * Slower to create and destroy
  * Less hard to program and debug (not easy!)
* Threads
  * Use less memory (Shared memory space)
  * Context switching cheap
  * Communication cheap (via queues and shared memory)
  * Fast to create and destroy
  * Harder to program and debug

#### Thread-safe
* A property of software, or a routine or a class
* Does it behave 'well' when running in a thread (sharing memory)
* Deadlock ("mortal embrace")
  * Example with two people and two tools
* Race Condition
  * When the results vary due to
  * How to avoid: using semaphors, queues, and other techniques
* Ruby GIL
* Higher level constructs, e.g. Actors (threads that only talk through queues)
  * See [Celluloid Actor Based Library for Ruby](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid)

### Queueing Systems: RabbitMQ

#### Queueing and SOA
* SOA: Divide software into independent "services" that talk to each other
  * Client: code that needs the service
  * Server: code that implements the service
* Previously: SOA required REST between servers ('synchronous' - why?)
* Queueing is a fundamentally different way of creating services and concurrency
* Syncrhonous:
  1. Client makes a request (HTTP get) and waits
  1. Server Receives request
  1. Server does the service, during which client and server are waiting
  1. Server sends response
  1. Client is free to continue processing
* Asynchronous
  1. Client makes a request ('Publish' to a queue)
  1. Client can now continue
  1. Server picks next item off queue and does the service.
  1. When service complete, notifies client to use the result.
* That's the theoretical framework

#### RabbitMQ: One of several implementations
* Runs in a process of it's own
* Defines the following terminology
  * Producers: Software that sends messages
  * Consumers: Software that consumes (and processes) messages
  * Queues: FIFO "holding area"  for messages
  * Message: A bit of data which often incorporates an action or command
  * Exchange: Receives messages from producers, and sticks them into a queue
  * Acknowledgement: So that if the server dies before finishing, the message gets given to someone else
  * Durability: So that if the Queueing Service dies, the content of the queue survives

##### Demonstration
* Review the scenarios from before

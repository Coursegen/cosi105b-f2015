* **Team**: Team Interim Report: For example, include background on how project has progressed so far, how the team has worked together, what design choices you made that were interesting, what challenges you overcame. Submit your github repo to [CodeClimate Free](https://codeclimate.com/github/signup) to look at the static analysis and include that in your report as well as the url to your github. <%= team_deliverable "Team interim report, 1-2 pages, pdf, Informal progress report" %> **[GRADED FOR PARTICIPATION ONLY]**
* **Trip Advisor**: Experiment with Trip Advisor. Look at the Hotels page for a large city: New York, Paris, London, Tokyo. Enter some dates for a hotel stay and see the prices come up for dozens of hotels. Think about what is behind that.

  One fact to start with, that makes it even more complicated,  is - TripAdvisor is not a travel agency. It does not manage the prices or availability for these hotels, or make the bookings - that is handled by the online travel agencies like Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity. <%= deliverable "Do some googling and take some guesses about what Trip Advisor's architecture is to handle the prices and availability for hotels" %> **[GRADED FOR PARTICIPATION ONLY]**
* **Teams:** Continue working on nT 0.4

<%= homework_hdr %>
* Watch and Read: [Basics of Database Sharding](https://youtu.be/W6pFKihvqH4). and [5 Early Lessons from Rapid High Availability Scaling](http://mikepackdev.com/blog_posts/40-5-early-lessons-from-rapid-high-availability-scaling-with-rails). Don't be concerned that Rails is mentioned, the concepts and principles are fundamental. Please read this and watch this material closely, it is quite important. <%= deliverable "Answer warmups in Latte" %>
* Finish everything under nT 0.4 and before.  Do the work in your portfolio, submit it to github. <%= team_deliverable "Also zip together your directory and post it to latte."%>**GRADED FOR PARTICIPATION ONLY**

#### Discussion
* Points Raised in the reading
  * Multiple questions about denormalization
  * Sharding
    * Why would anyone ever use anything other than Hash lookup
    * How to apply it to nanoTwitter
    * Is it always a good idea?
    * How does consistent hashing even work?
  * Terms
    * Chokepoint
    * Indexing: Note the uniqueness argument too
    * Universal User: What?

#### Some Background

* <%= link_to_topic :nt_load_testing %>

#### What is scaling?
* Measuring performance:
  * How many Xs per second?
  * and/orhow long does it take to Y?
* Analysis
  * Instrumentation (basically logging)
  * Deep thought
  * Identify the bottle neck
* Action
  * Remove the bottle neck

<%= callout("Note for first day of class:", " Each day of class has a page on this web site. The first section of that page is always the homework due on that very day. So in other words, the homework listed here is actually 'pre-work' for day one. We will go over this in a little more detail during class.") %>

1. Locate and continue going through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). You will be responsible for lesson 1-44 over the next week and a half. You will then have to do and submit lesson 45 as homework.
1. Study the requirements for the first programming assignment: <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. You will be using what you've learned about programming in your previous courses. Yes, it's a new langauge, but really the basic ideas are exactly the same. We are working on problem solvingn as much as anything. Come ready to discuss the approach you will take in class.

#### What is this course about: Software Engineering and Design
* Introduce Pito, where I came from, and why I am excitied about this course.
* Look at: <%= link_to_topic :pitofaq %>
* Here are the <%= link_to_topic :books_cosi105 %>
* Here are the <%= link_to_background :goals_cosi105 %>
* The prime source for this course is this web site itself!

#### Not-Mandatory-but-HIGHLY-recommended
* Every Friday from 2:00 to 4:00 we have a lab/workshop.
* My experience teaching this course is that most of you will need this to be successful
* There is no lecture, just Q&A with me and the TAs on anything that will help you out (usually it's homework related.)

#### If you weren't able to register
* Some people will drop so room will likely open up
* Come to all the classes, and do all the work
* Submit homeworks via email to the TAs
* **Add your name** to the [Waiting List for Cosi 105b](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1EKqLhbdsHLm8GkZO6qL3jJKK8f_iCX6unON_7niLg0s/viewform)

#### 30 Minute Quick Assignment
* <%= link_to_background :leveling %>

#### Homeworks and Grading
* Yes there is a fair bit of homework
* You are responsible for reading the lecture's page before each class
<%= callout("Previous Students Have Said", " Pay close attention to this. It's not complicated if you do. Still, almost everyone got it wrong the first few times. ") %>
* Some homeworks have explicit deliverables:
	* Will be clearly marked as "deliverable" or "team deliverable"
	* Are numbered, X.Y - X is the lecture number and Y is the homework for this lecture
	* Those are submitted to the appropriate spot in Latte, either as a .pdf (for writing) or as a .zip file
* The portfolio
	* Where all your programming work has to happen
	* Look carefully at <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>.
	* Your portfolio will be formally reviewed every week for progress

<%= callout("NOTE", " Often there is a concrete deliverable, a blog post, a zip file with code, etc. Those have to be submitted to LATTE") %>

#### Skills Inventory
* **Whether you are officially registered or want to be on the wait list**
* *Really quickly* Fill in [Skills Inventory](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WSdeyKt0tjej7LkKB-CHc05X9-uXCkaUp8jEfLEBPJQ/closedform). (This page is protected until the day of class) Obviously this is not graded. The purpose is to help us put together good teams. **Do it now please**

#### Project

* All students will work in teams on their version of <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_outline %>
* We will form teams of exactly four students. You will be assigned to a team.
* Let's look at what it's like to <%= link_to_topic :working_in_teams %>

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>

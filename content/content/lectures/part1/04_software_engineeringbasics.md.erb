* Reading and Watching: As you read the article and watch the video try to figure out what some of the reasons are for failures in software projects. Are they failings of human nature or failings of science and methodology? Do the authors believe that in the future failure due to software will eventually be eliminated? How do those lessons apply to what happened with the original healthcare.gov web site? Were the problems fundamental computer science related or were they caused by easily avoided human error? Do you think software systems like that are fundamentally more complex and in fact exceed the ability of any individual to grasp?
  * Read [R.Charette, “Why Software Fails - IEEE Spectrum.”](http://bit.ly/1x5YG1n)
  * Watch [Healthcare.gov failure: Analysis and discussion](http://youtu.be/Rl5WFz6Gi28) ([also available here...](http://www.frequency.com/video/cs169-v13-w8l2s7/132108449))
  * <%= deliverable "Write a 1-page response to the questions I posed above. Support your arguments with references to the paper or other sources. PDFs only accepted." %>
* Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %> in your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>, directory `movies-2`. You need to understand the assignment, and implement the first part, which is the MovieData class and all it's methods. Think about how you would check that the methods are working correctly. We will review the work in the portfolio so you don't need to put anything into Latte. We will look at some students' solutions in class and do a design review and discussion.

#### Discussions
* Based on the readings and video lets discuss common and not so common for software failure.

<%= include_topic :software_engineering %>

#### Code Review
* We will look at two students' movies-2 solutions to far

#### Next Class
* Look at homework: <%= link_to_next_lecture %>

title: Nano Twitter Project Outline
---
#### Approximate Recipe

Each step in this outline has a name which I use to refer to it elsehwere in this course. Notice that you will probably jump around or be working on more than one step at a time. So this is not a precise recipe, more like an outline to help you find your way in the project.

##### nanoTwitter 0.1: Foundation

* **\[DBSCHEMA\]** Design relational database schema (i.e. one for the whole app.) Decide what tables you will have, what the attributes (columns) are for each table, what the primary and foreign keys are, and what the associations are (i.e. one to many, many to one, many to many.)
* **\[UIDESIGN\]** Design/layoutuser interface of NT. Key screens and forms. Develop it as a paper prototype and/or using Balsamiq.com. Start with a paper sketch for each page. Remember to note where there are links and buttons, and what the various text boxes are. No need to immitate the real twitter. Do whatever you want but make sure the User Interface functionality that is listed in <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_functionality %> is covered.
* **\[ROUTES\]** Before coding up the sinatra app, sit down and design all urls that you will have to implement in the code. <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_functionality %> gives you the outline, but here you need to describe all of them. Do this before you code. Document them in the Readme. For now you can ignore the REST Api routes.
* **\[nanoTwitter 0.1\]** Use ActiveRecord and Sqlite3 for development (local) db. Build migrations for the User table. Add some fake users. Use the one (or two) of the actual sketches from from \[UIDESIGN\] to implement .html.erb files for that view in the view directory to display the views. Make sure the basic flows work: db:migrate, launch the server, display users, etc.

##### nanoTwitter 0.2: First Minimal Implementation

* **\[MIGRATIONS\]** Write and validate the complete set of migrations for the **\[DBSCHEMA\]** you designed above. You should have all the tables built in the database.
* **\[AUTHENTICATION\]** Implement "fake" authentication test from the <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_functionality %>
* **\[SEEDDATA\]** Implement a large body of seed data with automation. For each table in your database you want to populate it with real looking data. You can use the faker gem to give you real looking data. Generate fake users, tweets, follows, and everything else. Notice that generating fake follows is a little tricky logically because a user cannot follow themselves. Tie your code to Rake db:seed
* **\[nanoTwitter 0.2\]** Clean up the directory to get rid of any random files. Write a readme.md in the root directory. Create a github repo (one for all team members) and push APP 0.2 up to Github\]

##### nanoTwitter 0.3: Core functionality

* **\[UNITTESTS\]** Write set of unit tests with MiniTest. (RSpec is also ok, but I recommend MiniTest. It will give you fewer headaches.) This is a good opportunity to look at your Sinatra application and try to break it down into several files/classes. Any non-trivial Sinatra based app defines some classes which work independently of the Sinatra framework. Try to figure out how to do that. You should have several unit and integration test.
* **\[TESTINTERFACE\]** Implement the complete test interface from the <%= link_to_section :nt, :nt_functionality %>. Use TDD to do this.
* **\[CODESHIP\]** Set up Continuous Delivery using www.codeship.com. Each team should get a single Codeship account (free). Follow their instructions to set up automatic deployment of your code so that each time you push new sources to github, Codeship sees this and automatically runs your test suite to make sure verything still works.
* **\[nanoTwitter 0.3\]** Clean up the directory to get rid of any random files. Write a readme.md in the root directory containing information that would be useful to another developer trying out your code. Update your repo (one for all team members) with nanoTwitter 0.3 and tag the release.

##### nanoTwitter 0.4: Testing and Deployment

* **\[HEROKU\]** Have Codeship deploy to Heroku. Make sure tests still run.
* **\[MANUALTEST\]** Once nT is up on heroku, try having all three team members log into it at the same time and do some tweeting.
* **\[LOADTEST\]** Investigate and choose a way to load test your app. Use loader.io. Configure your app and heroky accordingly.

##### NanoTwitter 0.5: Inital Load Testing
**Here are important instructions: <%= link_to_topic :nt_load_testing %>**

* **\[INSTRUMENT\]**Investigate and choose a way to instrument your test app. Use new relic. Configure your app and heroku accordingly.
* **\[RUNLOADEXPERIMENT\]**Design and run a series of load tests and write a report of your findings
* **\[NEWWEB\]** Switch web server from WebBrick; try others, measure.
* **\[IMPROVESCHEMA\]**Update your schema to put indeces and other enhancements and see the effect on scaling
* **\[nanoTwitter 0.5\]** Clean up the directory to get rid of any random files. Update your readme.md. Tag the release and update your repo.

##### nanoTwitter 0.6: Advanced Scaling

* **\[REDIS\]** Investigate and figure out how to setup a Redis Caching service
* **\[CACHING\]**Consider where to add caching and do some more experiments to see how
* **\[SCALEEXPERIMENT\]**Design and execute scaling experiments and see the differences

##### nanoTwitter 0.7: Web Service API and Client

* **\[APIROUTES\]**Go back to the beginning Design external API urls. Implement them as further Sinatra routes.
* **\[CLIENTLIB\]**Write client libraries for your APIs.
* **\[CLIENTLIBTEST\]**Write a complete set of tests for them
* **\[nanoTwitter 0.7\]** Clean up the directory to get rid of any random files. Update your readme.md. Tag the release and update your repo.
